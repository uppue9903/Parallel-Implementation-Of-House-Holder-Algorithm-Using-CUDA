# Parallel-Implementation-Of-House-Holder-Algorithm-Using-CUDA
This repository provides the implementation and supporting resources for the parallelized version of the Householder QR decomposition algorithm, designed to run efficiently on GPUs using CUDA streams. This work is based on the research presented in the paper Enhancing QR Decomposition: A GPU-based Approach to Parallelizing the Householder Algorithm with CUDA Streams.
