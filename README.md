# Parallel-Implementation-Of-House-Holder-Algorithm-Using-CUDA
This repository provides the implementation and supporting resources for the parallelized version of the Householder QR decomposition algorithm, designed to run efficiently on GPUs using CUDA streams. This work is based on the research presented in the paper Enhancing QR Decomposition: A GPU-based Approach to Parallelizing the Householder Algorithm with CUDA Streams.

# Introduction
QR decomposition is critical for various linear algebra applications such as signal processing, optimization, and numerical computations. Traditional sequential implementations face scalability challenges. This repository implements a GPU-optimized parallel version of the Householder QR decomposition algorithm using CUDA streams, achieving significant performance improvements while maintaining algorithmic integrity.
